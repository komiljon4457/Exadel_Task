*************I am going to show steps in Linux based PC***********************

These are the steps that I would go through to toubleshoot the issue:

1. I go for my CLI(Command Line Terminal) to check whether I have SSH client installed for my PC (for linux OpenSSH client Command Line application)
2. IF not, I will install through sudo apt install <name>
3. There are basically 2  authentication method to establish connection with remote server through SSH
 a) through direct password
 b) key- based authentication

*Note 

Since I am accessing to my server, I can directly connect through the command  ----- ssh username@host_ip_address-------
 
If I need to connect to remote server, I have to generate keys in ssh server then I exchange keys with remote server or Easy way - I can type password with certain port and host address that I am accessing.
